### Growth Mindset

Growth mindset to me is about recognizing that skills can be acquired and learned through effort invested even if the growth process can be arduous at times.

**Reminders on how to stay in a growth mindset:**

- Everyone gets stuck from time to time and learning to ask for help is part of the process
- Taking breaks is needed to stay in a positive headspace
- Focusing on the small victories that come with each step towards progress
