# Reflections and Discussion Class 02

## 02 - The Coder's Computer

For the most part interfacing with the system will be done with something called 'the terminal'.  In short it's pretty similar to old-school DOS which has turned into the command line for windows systems and a good number of the commands are pretty similar except with some additions when it comes to interfacing with anything remote.

### Other Notes

* Typical commands such as cd, mkdir, cd .., are similar
* pwd is a new one which mean print working directory (instead of the full working directory always being displayed)
* ls lists what is in the current working directory instead of dir
* tree can also be useful which shows the layout of everything in that directory including the subfolders
