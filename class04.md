## Structure web pages with HTML

It's easy to get lost in the weeds when trying to design a site from scratch.  The first (and most important thing) to complete is a plan for how the site is going to look in the end (wireframe).  Sketching out how it'll look, where images might be, where text and links will be located, as well as how each page might link to each other.  Beyond that it's a matter of including snippets of HTML to provide the backbone of the content and structure and then stringing the snippets together in a bare-bones site.  Styling, colors, and exact presentation will be determined later on through CSS but the general functionality will be there.
