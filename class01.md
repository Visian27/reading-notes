## 01 - Reflections on Markdown

Markdown is a method of writing quick and dirty pages using shorthand instead of html tags which can bog things down.  A limited number of ways a person can markdown in... markdown but it gets the job done fairly quickly and additional ones can always be looked up.

### General Notes

* Typical tags involve ### to indicate the type of heading used at the front of the line
* No paragraph tags needed, just type away
* Bold text is either flagged by two ** or with __ on either side
* Italics are similar to bold but only one character used for the tag
* Block quotes can be inicated by a > at the front of each line
* Lists can be ordered or unordered with either a number or an * at the front of each line (other characters can be used for unordered lists as well)
