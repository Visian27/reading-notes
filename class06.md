## Dynamic web pages with Javascript

So far most of what has been going on with the pages in html and css has all been centered around pushing or displaying information.  No input or computations have been going on so there really hasn't been much of an interactive experience.  Javascript changes that and allows for snippets of code to ineract with the user, asking for inputs, and producing outputs accordingly.  All in all the three can work together but with a number of limitations which are sure to be addressed in later courses.

### Other notes

* While var is a viable option, typically only let and const are used
* _console.log() a way to print out whatever is in the parens
* prompt, to get info from the user.  The question in quotes in the parens
* alert, puts whatever is in the parens on the screen
* To isolate a script, put it into replit.com and see if it runs properly first before copying it over into VSC.
