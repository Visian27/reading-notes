## Dynamic web pages with Javascript

### Other notes

* While var is a viable option, typically only let and const are used
* _console.log() a way to print out whatever is in the parens
* prompt, to get info from the user.  The question in quotes in the parens
* alert, puts whatever is in the parens on the screen
* To isolate a script, put it into replit.com and see if it runs properly first before copying it over into VSC.
