## Programming with JavaScript

JavaScript is fairly similar to traditional programming languages with objects, functions, logic operators, and loops.  

### Other Notes

* Function definitions are simply "function functionName() {}"
* Function calls are "functionName()"
* DRY code - Don't Repeat Yourself
* Operators are basically the same as with any other programming language

* x=x+1 is a re-assignment
* x++ increment
* x+=2 assignment
