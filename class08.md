## Operators and Loops

Javascript follows the same general rules for assignments and boolean operators as almost any other programming language.  These tend to go hand in hand with conditional statements (which leads right into loops).  Traditional loops and conditionals are the same as they would be in C++ with if, do-while, while, and for following the same syntax as previous languages as well.

### Other Notes

* Variables defined inside loops seem to vanish after the loop completes
* if (){}
* if else (){}
* while (){}
* for (let x=0; x<5; x++){}
* Commands like break and continue are included as well which seem to have made a comeback from the "this is bad programming" stigmas of old.
