### Summary

Code will be typically be in one place for storage (server/remote) and another place when being worked on (workstation/local).  When a project or repository is to be worked on, it will need to either be cloned (if first time) or pulled from the place where it's stored through terminal git commands such as clone or pull.  After the code is worked on locally either through VSC or other method it first must be staged via the add command, then confirmed through the commit command, and finally exported using the push command.  During this process it is important to add a message when confirming the staged code so that others will know what was worked on.

### Important Commands

* git clone _insert page here_
