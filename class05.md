## Design web pages with CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a method of overriding the default styling assigned to HTML tags.  In days of old each line had to be assigned separate style tags but now all of those rules are put into a tidy external CSS document.  Things like font size, font, color, etc. for a single element can be changed from default with a single command in CSS ever time that element shows up.  Just like with HTML, a good way of finding out all the tags that can be modified is just to google a cheat sheet.

In the event of multiple CSS commands, the most recent is selected.  In the case of inline vs. external or internal.

### Rough notes from reading

* CSS is a rule based language
* CSS rule opens with a selector or the html tag which will be targeted
* Make declarations within the braces (property and value)
* Obsolete CSS is still in use so that older sites can still work
* For external CSS there needs to be a link to it in the head section link rel="stylesheet" href="thething.css"
* Internal CSS and inline are both allowed but probably not the best

### Other notes

* border width and margin will need tweaking often and some experiementation
